a jock strap, just not as much of it,
that's all. He also assures me that
it does hold everything in place
with no slipping around.
The one thing that Rhonnie did
apologise about was the price.
Although he has tried to make his
products as cheaply as possible,
he cannot see any way around the
exchange rate. I checked the price
of the S.P Herb in Aust dollars and
there is quite a difference. SUS300
works out to $US430 and that was
yesterday. Rhonnie has set up a
layby system because he has this
problem with other overseas orders
he has taken. Even to send USS50
at a time works outto A$70. Bloody
hell! A bloke would have to give up
beer and fags just to pay for this.
Sheryl and I both read the info pack
and I felt that the S.P.Herb was
probably more suited to our
particular needs. One of the things
we took into consideration was of
all the tranny boys I know of and
those I have met, Sheryl and I are
best placed to 'lose' $400.
Everyone else is on some kind of
welfare or have jobs that don't pay
a great deal. Shervl and I. because
of my mor.ey skills, have the extra
cash to play with. If the S.P.Herb is
everything that Rhonniesays, then
I've gained my freedom and we
have one in the country to get some
decent pies of. If not, well we have
the knowledge that Rhonnie and
his devices are not to be trusted.
So I haven't really lost anything
either way, have? The bottom line
is that one of us is going to have to
trust him and take the plunge if we
are to find out for sure if Rhonnie is
for real and it may as well be me.
Jn brotherhood, Jamie.
LETTERS
This is an excerpt from one of Sam's recent letters:
Dear Jasper,
Thankyou for the la' est newsletter. I read with much interest the feelings
of Julian. It is absurd to think that the medical profession in one sector
will, without any has5!e, give the go ahead for surgery when we have
undergone the requir~d time of hormone treatment, and then in another
sector they seem t.) be oblivious to the mental anguish of having to be
told no when we have done our time, so to speak, how to take away
someone's dignity. For crying out loud, isn't it obvious the trauma we
have to go through if we have facial and chest hair, look and sound like
a man and yet have to wear breasts 24 hours a day, trying to hide them
so we don't betray ourselves and thus becoming the focal point of
entertainment for some uneducated and ignorant people. Sure I may
sound bias being afellowtransgenderist, but even before I accepted who
I was, there was no question in my mind that this process of operations
is an obvious and 11atural step and nobody has the right to be telling us
what we should be doing. I have had no hormone treatment or surgery
but the confidencE. I feel when I am relatively flat chested when strapped
down is bliss and in my own small way gives me a bit of dignity. So I can
well believe Julian when he says that the most important move in his life
was the removal of his breasts, giving back freedom and dignity. Yes, we
have every right to demand, not ask, but demand the right to surgery and
the control over our own lives and bodies. So I wish you all the success
Jasper and to any other brothers out there.
Yours in brotherhood,
Sam. Darwin

MONTHLY NEWSLETTER lO DECEMBER 1992
In this issue of our newsletter, I
have included a questionnaire
that Max and I nutted out
together. Max and I are due for
surgery sometime next year but
the both of us are not in a
financial position to undertake
our respective mastectomies.
Unlike our trannie sisters, a
significant portion of our surgical
process is not covered medically
or our costs reduced to a
reasonable level because of
supply and demand. Therefore
we decided to embark upon a
campaign to get Medicare to
change its policy on our
situation.
But we have to start small. The
government is certainly not
willing to foot the bill for complete
genital surgery, however, it may
be persuaded to cover a
significant amount of our breast
I surgery if they were to be
convinced that it was "life
threatening" for us to do without
it. Now, the angle we can all
take is to prove that it is indeed
life threatening but not in a
physical sense but rather in an
emotional and psychological
one. As we all know, this is the
truth of the matter anyway.
The questionnaire is designed
to make the government aware
of our position as FTM
transgenderists- a group that is
virtually invisible in society's
eyes and even less so to Govt
departmental bodies. And as
INTEf.o no-on~ else around us (iethe gay and
lesbian community , the medical
profess:on, Social Security, MTF
group> etc) is doing c.hything about
our s:tuation then I guess we have to
haul en our arrnour and wage our own
battle.
It is my opinion that our situation as â€¢
FTM 1s a women's issue as we are
gene'.ically female, and as such, like
Â· fbanks to Jamie for
donating $50 to the
BWBB newsle:ller and
its running costs
any women's issue, the government
is ignoring it. We suffer from
patriarchy despite our male
identification.So it is up to we
brothers to make ourselves heard
and our right to human dignity felt.
Therefore I urge all of you to fill in
the questionnaire as truthfully as
you can and to return it to BWBB as
fast as you can. Even those of you
who are fortunate to already have
surgery, please fill it out as breast
surgery is only the first step in getting
government assistance. Other
surgeries may follow. Once
received, the questionnaires will
be converted to statistics which,
along with other research into the
S N A P S H QT private he~lth system and extent of
MTF medical coverage, will then
be presented to Medicare. In order
to give these statistics validation
and to make them LEGAL we need
you to give your name in this
instance. We are all on record
somewhere anyway (ie Social
Security, Births registrar, Medical
records etc) so don't inhibit yourself
in the name of privacy ..
Max and I are doing it for all of us.
We hope to set a precedent that
can follow in each State. If we can
get some financial coverage, if not
all, for our surgeries then we can all
hope to gain peace of mind more
quickly and less stressfully than we
had previously expected.

Dale has recently offered to
become the Victorian
representative for BWBB. This
means, that when tranny men who
contact Jasper and are from
Melbourne or beyond,they will be
referred on to Dale. Not only does
this mean that Dale receives more
local support but also the workload
of Jasper's is lessened. Of course,
the new men will naturally benefit
from Dale's wealth of experience.
Other branches of BWBB can be
seilup in other states if any of you
brothers feel confident about your
skills and experience. Just let me
know
The November edition of Campaign
magazine (a gay men's publication
readily available at most
Newsagents) featured an article
on transgender issues, profiling two
MTF and our very own Max. Max's
article is succinct and articulate
and he shares his feelinl)i on being
an FTM. Featured along side his
interview is a lovely photo of both
he and his partner, Judy. It's good
having more coverage of us boys
and to see new faces in the press.
Thanks Max. If interested, you can

NEWS
Recently, a Gay, Lesbian and HIV
people Anti-Violence rally was held
in Sydney. Though an important
event and well organised, it is
unfortunate that in all speeches
given, slogans and publicity used,
transgendered people were not
represented or included. Standing
in the crowd I was most upset at
speech after speech being directed
toward dykes and poofs and people
with HIV l>ut not myself or other
trannies who were present. How
many years have we fought
alongside the gay community for
their rights and dignity? Where's
the thanks? Trannies are victims of
violence too and certainly have
even fewer rights than gays. It was
quite ironic that the entertainment
for the day included three 'drag'
shows and was hosted by two men
in frocks! I am pleased to say that
local drag superstar, Cindy Pastel,
took to the stage with a placard
declaring "TranniHs and Bisexuals
are Queer too!". Good on her.
Jasper.
It was with great surprise and
pleasure that BWBB received a
phone call from the partner of a
trannie boy who is currently
undergoing his final surgery, even
as this goes to print. Ifs obvious
that he and his partner will need
much support during his
convalescence. It is a pity we
could recommend no-one to him
that had undergone similar surgery.
However, fort he rest of us brothers,
his experiences will be of great
importance and help to us all.
Congratulations go to Max from
Sydney who this month received
the go ahead for his first surgery -
mastectomy. Max will undertake
his breastsurgerywhen it becomes
financially viable for him and when
a suitable surgeon is found. We
wish Max luck in his surgical
process.
We welcome a new recipient of
theBWBB newsletter;Johnnyfrom
Melbourne and look forward to his
possible participation.
Recently, Jamie and his partner,
Cheryl, from Qld visited Sydney for
a much deserved holiday. Whilst in
the Big Smoke, they took the
opportunity to meet with Jasper
and Max and their respective
partners. For all three boys, it meant
being able to see the past, present
and future of all their processes
and as such the visit was priceless.
Hopefully, many more of us can
meet and share our experiences.
Hi to all the other BWBBers.
Summer has arrived early this year
and I sit writing these words to you
stripped down as far as self-image
will allow me. It's at this time of year
that I wonder why I live in Qld at all.
Anyway ...
A couple of weeks ago my partner
and I spent part of our holiday in
Sydneybeingcompletetouristsand
seeing a few of the sights. We also
met up with Jasper, Max and theirpartners for the first time. And
wonderful meetings they

teeth and waiting some more. A
feeling we all know f r too well. I'll
say goodbye and hope by this time
next month I will have started my
shots.
Aside, I've included some more
info about the HERB ...
I managed to speak to Rhonnie in
question and he did sound very
sincere about everything he said.
We also discussed the cleaning
solution he includes. It sounds very
much like our denture cleaning
tablets, although he was unfamiliar
with any of the brand names I
mentioned. He also said his stuff
had been cleared by the doctors
over there. We discussed the
problem of distance and he is willing
to send us a four week supply to
start with and arrange for a
were too. I'd like to thank
Jasper, Max and their
partners for the friendliness
