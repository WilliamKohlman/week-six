to secure my personal happiness,
but I have the entitlement to privacy
and noi having unwanted attention
focussed onto me. Isn't that the
basic rights of a human being?
Sometimes I wonder. ..
I would not change my life for
anything in the world - my scars
celebrated a birthday, a year since
I had my double mastectomy
operation and I've had to review
the effects of this step in my life. I
can state, quite confidently, that it
was probably the most important
decision of my life and the most
beneficial.
I've never looked back, not once.
I feel I am at last a whole person
rather than hall of one or a shadow
of what I wanted to be. The scars
on my chest have faded and are
still noticeable but I still vividly
recall all the feelings leading up to
the operation and the feelings well
before that stage. I was diagnosed
as a transsexual (es we were then
known) at the age ol 18. I suppose
it sounds precocious in terms of
years, but it was more of a
confirmation of what I had been
feeling all of my life.
I began hormone treatment soon
after. The emotional anguish of
starting treatment, (t hough all the
effects that began, I welcomed
and delighted in) but still being
hatt-waythere between sexes was
immense. I can sympathise with
anyone going through this. The
two year waiting period was
prescribed and then, knowing I
would eventually have surgery, I
began to prepare mentally for his
changes. When I elected to have
the operation I was 19, though I
did not get to that stage until soon
after my 20th birthday. as I said, I
had no problems, no opposition and
I just cannot see WHY the same
procedure becomes an uphill battle
for any other transgenderist.
It seems so useless for me to urge
others to NOT be disheartened by
the medical profession's bias. How
can I say it -\he radical changes to
my life, I :a'1 only say it's worth
anything to get there. For me, it is
the ultimate licence o/ freedom. I am
to anyone's eyes a man. No
questions lsked, no sly looks and
sidelong ylances, being written off
as a "butc~1', a dyke or thrown into a
category of guessing (I recall once
two gL';''> making bets on what sex I
was, within my hearing and how that
made me feel) I pass as a genetic
male. I on wear whatever I like
without t~ a trussing breasts and the
in surgery, between the basic
mastectomy and the shaping and
defining of the chest tissue which I
think need some ex.amination.
I am pleased with my own reults and
I have also spent time, before and
after my operation, doing weighttraining Â· nothing serious but
providing some muscle there, but I'd
like to have compared the options.
Really, it's to find a plastic surgeon
that can give you the options and
cater to the requirements of the
transgenderist, that's important. So,
good luck. Julian (NSW)

such is my

hesitant about

my scars are the result of a motor

cliche!). I find mysett self-conscious
that I have these scars- though they
have faded somewhat after a year
and a suntan but what I wish to
express is the freedom , the
happiness as a result, that I am,
finally, what I always wanted to be -
a man.
Don't be discouraged, hang in there.
As I said, it's worth it . I want to add
too, that it's only through BWBB that

MONTHLY NEWSLETTER #9 NOVEMBER 1992
So finally, Rhonnie Reed, t~ e guy
who makes T.R.A.M.P (whd1 he
now calls HERB (Helping E ery
Reborn Brother), has responded
and sent us some infor,-ration
direct. Jamie (Old) also serÂ·t us
some material from Rhonn: 3.
What gets me is the guy's .-:;!owing
description of how wond.:,ful the
HERB is without actU<''ly saying
what the damn thing is rn~de of,
how it works or its life expe~tancy .
Even the material sent le Jamie
made us none-the-wiser, but I'm
glad to say that the material that
arrived at the BWBB post box sheds
a little light on the subject. So here
goes .. .
Concern One: How the hell are
you able to pee through the HERB?
Rhonnie: "The Urinary Device is
made of very soft comfortable white
rubber. It does NOT invade the
urinary canal in any way .. .it meets
the urinary opening, channeling the
urine to the base unit where it is
then transported by a soft tube to
the urine canal in the back of the
penis.
After the one week 'break-in' period
you can wear this unit 24 hours a
day, provided you remove it once a
dayforcleaning" Atwoweekstarter
cleaning kit is included with the
device.
Concern Two: How can the HERB
get an erection when initially ff acid?
Rhonnie: "The Ercetion Insert is
placed in the back opening of the
penis and creates a simulated
INTRO
erection, duration of your choice!"
Concern Three: How do I cum
when wearing the HERB for
intercourse?
Rhonnie: "It comes with a Personal
Stimulator which is a small vibrator
that is placed against your "hidden"
penis (clitoris) for FTM stimulation
during intercourse so you can
experience wh2.t c; 1
1er guys do!"
Detailed drawings included in
directions when purchased.

Concern Four: If the HERB is so
realistic, then what is it made out
of?
Rhonnie: "The penis and balls of
HERB are created out of latex and
plastics. The sizes in penis length
are S 31/2", M 4", L 5". All our
products are soft to touch and look
totally real, are comfortable, retain
body heat and (except Herbie- the
T.P) are waterproof plus are skintoned to you."
So there you have it. An explanation
for the HERB. The photo shown
indeed looks quite impressive.
Rhonnie also makes available an
S.P HERB (Stand and Pee HERB)
which is basically the same as the
original but without the erection
device, thus reducing the cost to
US$300 as opposed to the US$500
price tag for the sex-functional
HERB.
Other products available from his
company, Creative Growth
Enterprises, include the original
"Herbie" which is basically a bulge
filler cut vaguely to a penis shape
and dyed to skin-tone. It's made
from industrial foam and comes
with a harness The prices is US$40
or US$70 for two.
His newest product is the "Soft Sex
Kit" - The T.S Penile Extension
System (where does he get these
names!) He says "this extremely
realistic penis with balls is totally
different. The inner core feels like a
normal erection, the outer 'skin' is
soft just like real skin! The action
created is that this posthesis 'gives'
with each motion exactly like the
real one!. .. lncluded in the kit is a
personal stimulator for the
FTM ... and the harness is skintoned to you. The 'magic' powder
makes the 'skin' feel completely
real, condoms and complete
directions are sent with each kit."
The cost of this product is US$75
plus US$4.50 shipping. What on
earth is this 'magic' powder.
Anyway, the photo Qiven shows cont. oack cover ... 
BfNOER FILMS FROM lHf U.S.
This year's San Franciscan Gay
and lesbian Film Festival featured
an inter-gender programme which
included a number of short films
concerning gender and women and
we men .â€¢ Perhaps some of these
films may make their way to
Australia in the fringe cinema. It's
Â· interesting to note that all of these
below-mentioned films are directed
by women.
' Billed was "A Spy (Hester Does
'The Doors')" - a lesbian Jesusdrag music video featuring Hester
Reeve (1992 Dir Suzie Silver),
"Passing" (1991 Dir Sara Whitely)
in which a woman is transformed
from her everyday self to a
masculine, "Stafford's Story"
(1992 Dir Susan Muska) in which
language. and image are at odds
with a dizzy rer1tlezvous at a sex
club and "Juggling Gender" (1992
Dir Tami Gold) which is a mini doco
about a lesbian with a beard and
how it effects her and others
people's opinion of gender.

lHHSl flM NEWSUlHH
The October issue of the American
"FTM" newsletter has arrived in
my hot little hands (and in Dale's
mysteriously). This issue is mainly
comprised of tranny letters, in fact,
there are five pages of them! It
seems as though the editor.James,
will be leaving the publication next
year and is looking for a new editor
to replace him. We wish him luck in
his intention to concentrate more
fully on his writiqg and public
speaking (on gender issues). We
have reprinted so~e information in
our news section from this current
issue.
From the newsletter we learned
that the regular FTM get-tog ethers
are continuing to attract a good
tum-out. Their July!meeting had 24
guysattendwhilsttlieAugustSocial
was populated by 30. Meanwhile,
the September Support meeting
was also "very positive". Remember
this is only for the California reg ion,
other groups exist elsewhere in the
States.Thethought of24 men under
the one roof is quite awesome for
us here considering BWBB has a
national population of around
twelve!
Of interest is also several letters
reprinted from Rhonnie Reed (yes,
the guy who sells T.R.A.M.P) who
appears very active within the FTM
community. One letter in particular
gives a detailed suggestion of how
to set up and operate an Orientaion
Board of Directors within the FTM
community apparantly to prevent
brothers of differing sexual
persuations from feeling alienated
within their own transgenderscene.
As he says, "The lack of education
as to the diversity of our people,
like any other population, has led
many to fear they don't 1it in',
thereby never getting the help and
support they so desperately want
and need." This Board, according
to Rhonnie's viewpoint, Â·would
comprise of an elected brother from
each sexual subculture Qe gay,
het,bietc)whowouldthenbecome
available to assist new members of
that particular persuasion and to
make sure that. his like-minded
brothers were getting their needs
met within the wider FTM
community. Phew! Big stuff. It will
be interesting to see the American
response in future FTM issues to.
his suggestions.
And finally there is a heart-touching
letter from the daughter of an FTM
man who writes of her e~periences
in coming to terms with her
'mothe(s' new gender and its effect
on them both. She_comes across
as intially confusedÂ· but now
educated and sensitive to her
'fathe(s' needs and choices. It's
wonderful to read feedback from
the people weÂ· effect and
encouraging to find that she is
ultimately accepting. Several
brothers, here in BWBB, with
children I'm sure can relate to that
gut-wrenching fear of rejection by
one's own child.
CHINfSf WOMAN HHS MANS

In the media section of the FTM
(USA) newsletter there was a
curious snippet on a 'woman' in
Beijing (China) who recei\ied the
testicles of a thirty year old man
who in return received her ovaries
during operations in July of this
year. This is billed as the "first
direct sex swap"! The extract goes
on to say that the "Doctor's
constructed a false peinis for the

penis and replaced it with a vagina

boggles! Evidently for the woman, F ~ A T "1 T R ~ the reasoning for 'he( sex change ._ i;..1 ._ double mastectomy AS my
