Dear Jasper,
Thanks very much for the
newsletter-It's great to know there
are others going through similar
experiences that I am and I find It
all very encouraging. You
merdioned a national weekend in
August for F2Ms. What a great
idea! Have you a date yet? I'd like
to be involved in fairly structured
times of sharing -operations, fears
etc, with some time for one to one
sharing and possibly some
counseling. Your other ideas in the
June newsletter sound good as
well.
months, but it was the full twelve
months before I had the double
mastectomy .because I couldn't
afford to have them done any
sooner! But that twelve months
would have been the longest I've
ever put in! And I was really glad
when I no longer had any breasts
as such.
In hindsight though, I wish I'd had
the hysterectomy done first. Why?
If you rely heavily on your breasts
for sexual arousal and pleasure -
after they are removed and your
nippies are repositioned you lose
all pleasurable sensation from that

I would like to be able to tape the

publication (eg an Australian FTM
Handbook). The material that will
come out of these discussions will
be very important to other FTM

years that follow. Only first names
will be used.
I'm really looking forward to seeing
as many of you as possible.

We recently received an
introductory letterfrom Edwige who
works at the Central Coast
Community Women's Health
Centre at Gosford. Edwige
identifies as an FTM man and in his
letter informs us that he is a part of
a transsexual support group there.
His role within the organisation is
as councellor including outreach
work. BWBB will be added to their
resource list and I also hope that a
good connection will be built
between ourselves and the Central
Coast.

We've just received the July issue
of the American FTM newsletter.
It's an amazing issue! There are
ten crowded pages full of personal
insights, reviews of gender events,
cross-dressing performers, articles
on FTM products, mail box, book
reviews and much more! There is
also a personal perspective by the
editor (James) on the history of the
newsletter and what the '90's holds
for we men.
We've reprinted from this issues, a
couple of press releases on penis
prosthesis made by other brothers.
I'm sure this is of great interest to
us all. I'm also pleased to say that
the newsletter mentions Jasper's
film as part of the S.F film festival.
For a photocopy of this newsletter
send $2.50 to BWBB or write to
FTM direct

Well, I've noticed in recent
overseas ne~letters and in some
local literature also, that we
transsexuals are now referring to
ourselvesas"transgenderists". The
change in temiinology certainly
makes sense, as logically, we are
not changing our sexuality but our
physical gender.I don' know who
coined the new label but it certainly
feels better than the previous one,
although it takes a 6ttle getting used
to. I'd be interested to see if the
new term will be used within medical
circles.
As a response, from this newsletter
on, BWBB will use the term
transgenderinsteadoftranssexual.
Hopefully this will be in agreement
with everyone.

For a less expensive but basic
prosthesis, here's what Randy
Ingersoll has to say about his
US$65 "Transitional Prosthesis"
(TP) ...
"At present the Transitional
Prosthesis is 85% waterproof and

them. H you happen to brush
against someone accidently (or on
purpose) they won't feel a hard
lump in your pants and wonder
what the problem is ... The
prosthesis can be washed in the
washer and easily dried on a towel.
Though the TP is not an exact
replica of the penis in appearance
(let's face it, l they're that close
they'll know it isn't real), for now I
have chosen to pursue functional
use.
My interest is to keep the cost
down. Each TP is handmade and
takes roughly four to seven hours
to make. They are available in
different skin tones. the life of the
TP is mostly determined by how
carefullyyouf pllowthe instructions
which are provided. I am available Â·
to anyone who has suggestions,
concerns oii problems. I also
Randy states that he has
experimented, modified and
improved the TP to the point it is
now at and will continue to do so.
You can get the TP in skin colours:
light, medium, dark or brown. Cost
is (all in US funds) One: $65, Two:
$120, Three: $375. Buy four or
more at $55 each. Shipping and
handling is included in price! And
he s.tates that delivery can be
between 2-4 weeks. Randy
welcomes any feedback on his
product and correspondence is
confidential.
Write to him at 315 Running Brook,
Mesquite, Texas 75149 USA
We'll also send for information to
publish in BWBB plus clear photos
Perhaps, l the product is good
enough, a few of us can pool our
funds to get the TP at the reduced
rate (US$55 around $70 Aus) for
four or more?
