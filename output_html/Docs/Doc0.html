BOYS will be BOYS
Newsletter #1 "'-lit' 1992
Well, quite a bit has happened since I last put pen to paper for Boys Will Be Boys.
Following what was basically a media blitz on my part, having been interviewd by
most major gay and lesbian publications locally (and interstate), I managed to get the
point across that the issue of F2M transsexuality is an invisible one that needs to be
dealt with, particularly in the lesbian community. The concept that quite alo.t of us
boys are out there in one form or other, is now beginning to become apparent to many
of us. I have been overwhelmed by the response to this support group from women who
know they are men. Eight F2M boys havE\ come to my attention within the last two
months. Though seemingly a small number, compared to knowing only a handful
previously and having met no-one before my gender change, this is quite incredible
and only goes to show that there are more of us out there than we may well have
imagined.
Naturally, this is only the tip of a v.:ry isolated iceberg. Many of us are still feeling
alienated or unsure of our decisions. Most of us lack sufficient information,
especially medical, to better aid our decisions. All of us need support. For those of
you on this mailing list please consider writing something of yourself and your
experiences for others to read. Only first names will be used and naturally no
adresses or phone numbers unless specifically given Â·for publication will be printed.
It's important that we share our thoughts, insecurities, excitement fears and
knowledge. This group can only work if each individual is prepared to participate,
even just a little. Don't leave this newsletter up to a dedicated few. This support
group can have a far reaching impact on the quality of our lives and the education of
the community at large. You don't have to already have changed yourself physically
yet, or ever intend to, to be involved. Your awareness of your male gender is all that
is relevant.
This is the first of our newsletters to be received as a continual addition to the info
kit you may already have. Hopefully, we'll have enough imput from you all (news,
medical info, tips, letters, fiction, book lists etc) to send it out every month.
Obviously funds are needed for photocopying, postage, contacting o'seas groups and
such, so any. _small financial donations would be much appreciated. We've published a
couple of letters written s~~cifically for this newsletter plus other relevant info. This
particular newsletter was put together by myself (Jasper) and newcomer, Alex from
Sydney.

Dear BWBB,
I found your letter heartnening. The info kit I found exciting, inspiring and bloody
terrifying. I will tell you a bit about myself.
I am 37 yrs old, a little bloke only 5ft 4" and 8 1/2 stone. I'm the third youngest of ten
and although born in the country lived most of my life in Sydney. I came to Newcastle
four years ago to do something with myself. I have just finished a University degree in
social welfare. Before coming here, I ran a goat farm and worked as a fencing
contractor. I've also been a builder's labourer and vet nurse.

It terrifies me to think that the things I have always dreamed about, my private
reality, have any meaning to anyone but me . Although I have hung around with
lesbians for 20 years, I have only ever fallen in love with straight women. Which is, as
you can imagine, totally a pain in the arse. Screws you around to the max. I feel totally
schizaphrenic at times.
Anyway, Jasper, what you are doing is great for us all and whatever I can do I will.
Regards Mike (NSW)
Dear Jasper (BWBB)
I'm glad to make your aquintance as a female-to-male transsexual. I myself am a
female-to-male transvestite. No interest in hormones or surgery but I cross dress
nearly 100% of the time and have been a man soul since birth. I'm glad to know we're
both running important projects. I'd like to receive the "Boys Will Be Boys"
newsletter.
All the best, Bet Power

The current issue of the American lesbian sex magazine "Bad Attitude" (Vol VII
#IV) features two photographs of an unamed F2M transsexual. He looks terrific.
Though obviously pre-op, this boy has worked-out hard to create a convincing male
torso (yes, even reducing his breasts down to virtually nothing!) with muscle-bound
shoulders and arms, plus a well-shaped chest and flat tummy. Now, for unkept people
like me, this is quite inspiring and a reminder for all of us on hormones that we can
build-up remarkably (if desired) within a short time if we make the effort. For
myself, there's not much point in having facial hair and a deep voice if my torso
remains that of a pre-pubescent boy! Anyway here's a photocopy of one of the snaps ...

The recent Australianmade documentary on
s piritual sexuality titled 11 Sacred Sex 11
, has been
showing around the
country for the last three
or four months. If it comes
your way then go and sec
it as it stars Annie
Sprinkle, and briefly, her
transsexual lover Les .
A nni e's presence 1n the
film saves it from tota l
boredom and an ovcre mph as is on
heterosexuality. I was
continued
lucky enough to catch up with her in Sydney and pass on in formation about B WBB for
her to give to Les, so perhaps we'l l hear from him sometime . In Sacred Sex, he strips
down to show the viewer the result of his many operations which of course includes
his penis. For this moment alone, the movie is a must for us boys. It's fantastic to
actually sec phalloplasty (a lmost) in the flesh rather than in some badly printed,
out-of-date medical book . His voice is also one of the deepest mal e voices I've ever
heard! He and Annie have also made a video of their experiences together,
d\JCumcnting Les' process and operations and it ncludes their first sex-session with
his then new penis. It's ca lled "Linda/Les and Annie" . We'll try and conv ince them to
send us a free copy and then raise the SSO needed to transfer it to Au stra li an VHS . In
the next newsletter we'll reprint Les' article, originally in "Rites or Passage" and
Wicked Women, on his thoughts toward Annie and hi s new sexuality .

Rccclltly, Jaspe r was filmed by Caytc Latta, a Sydlle y film maker, for a 12 minute
video titled 11 F2M 11 . The vid eo comprises short dialogues by Ja sper on a num hcr or
personal s ubjects, including fctishL.3, ch ildhood e tc. Though titl e d F2M, the vidrn is
more or a profile than an attempt at exploring th e issue of transscxuality but non e-
the-less does give F2Ms more visibility and opens discussion. The video will be
screened at this years Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras film festival in February
with the possibility of international screenings.
(Jasper: This video became quite overwhelming for me but not because of its content
(which is really not that interesting) or the fact that I was being filmed. In playing it
back it gave me the opportunity to step outside of myself and look at what and who I
had become in just under a year of hormone treatment. I could see this guy on film
with a goatee and poor excuse for a moustache. I could hear this, albeit slightly
queenie, man's voice. And it was me! All last year I had been unable to gain enough
distance from myself to see who was in the mirror, so it was quite a revelation to
watch. this video and finally say to myself that Jasper is refelected in the mirror, not
Francine (my previous name). Admitting that and letting her go is proving to be scary
and one of the saddest things in my life but I guess necessary. How do any of Syou
feel?)
F E A T u R E
Dear Fellows,
I guess my story is similar to many of yours.
I have at various times, attempted to live both as a man and as a womyn and
spent two years in the States where i lived and worked openly as a man.
My lovers credibility as both an American and well respected, leather dyke
made my welcome and acceptance as a man so much easier.
I was able to work In a hospital as a male nurse even though my nursing
registration had my female name plastered all over It and spent much of my
time savouring the freedom of living as a man.
This was not without Its problems, though these were basically of a personal
rather than political nature.
There was Initially some confusion for me regarding gender of my lover/s and
although I had a female lover, I was eventually able to become the lover of a
gay man who taught me some Invaluable things about sexuality and gender.
My lover was killed, and I with good Catholic guilt, abandoned my Y fronts
and moustache, and came home to Austalla, where I have tried to pursue the
life of my given gender.
It Is made harder for me, because although I am a leather person and a
respected top, I have all the acceptable feminine traits, such as long, blonde
hair and a slim build.
Fortunately though, I have no breasts and am quite tall, so androgny has
been both my saviour and my cloak to hide behind.
I call myself a man and feel like a man, although I have lacked the courage to
embark on changing my gender medically, for fear of ostraclzm and loss of
community (?).
The thing about my lifestyle at the present time Is that it is highly dangerous.
I work the beats 2 or 3 times per week and have had a few nasty encounters
with poofter bashers and with one gay man who was horrified to discover that
my cock was indeed rubber.
My life Is also Interwoven with lies, In that I am out to a very few people and
am constantly confusing people with my transient g~nder.
I have found that the dyke community In particular, very much wants you to
define yourself and that the community lacks compassion for those of us
who reject our cunts.
Fate intervened last week.
After an emergency op'for a ruptured ovarian cyst (oh, the anger of being
reminded on such a primitive level of ones femaleness), I find that I have
acute endometrlosis, a condition that can only be controlled by large
quantities of male hormones which suppress menstruation and ovulation.
The doctor counselled me In regard to the effects of the drug; hair growth,
voice changes, muscular shape, Increased muscle tone and bulk, enlarged 
clitoris, decrease In breast size and mood swings.
I was elatedl
Having put off medically altering my gender, I now find that a decision has
been made for me.
The drug Is called: DANAZOL, and Is a synthetic male hormone that Is
administered by Injection and eventually In tablet form.
As I have not started the drug as yet, (Monday Is the big day), I am unable to
report side effects and the success of this drug In altering my appearance.
What I do know Is that a hysterectomy will be necessary In approx' 12 months
time to finally cure the endometriosls (bliss!).
At the present time, I am quite a wimpy, academic sort of man with a strong
jaw and long hair bound In a plait.
I am hoping for a taut arse and a Kristian Schlater/ Robin Williams sort of
effect once my appearance starts altering but guess that this Is just wishful
thinking on my part.
I enjoy the gay, male leather bars, where I feel more at home and where I
have had acknowledgment of my gender as male.
Lets just hope _my _unlforms_still flt tn_ thr.e.e_mo..nths_tj_mel ___ _
I have often felt ashamed and saddened that I was unable to take steps to
transform my gender and didn't know whether I was a transsexual or not.
Isolation Is a living death.
I feel that the most Important aspect of this group is that there Is no
definition of what constitutes transsexuallty and therefore no rejection or
judgement.
You don't have to receive medical or surgical treatment to call yourself a
trannle or to be a man.
I am a member of the medical profession In Melbourne and am endeavouring
to find out about the medical status of F to M transsexuals in Melbourne,
which I believe is archaic.
Well, fellows, I would like to meet any boys who are embarking on this
journey or who just want to have a chat.
I would very much like to contribute to lessening the feeling of our Isolation
as men and as trannies.
Regards,
Dan, Melbourne.
