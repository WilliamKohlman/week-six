With a little trepidation, much
thought and a lot of self analysing,
I took a deep breath, then a giant
step forwards. Forwards into the
world of tranny boys and adopted
the new persona of being a man.
Now, here I am, a new kid in town.
But is this what I really want for my
now, my future?
Emphatically, from the rooftops of
my mind, body, heart and soul I
yell. YES! This is what I want. YES!
This is where I want to go. YES!
YES! A thousand times YES!
But It hasn't been an easy decision
to make as I'm sure you're all very
much aware if. My decision to
decision to become what I feel I
should've been all along is
constantly being reinforced .
Consciously, I made the choice to
be open from the onset with my
community, the lesbian communfy.
The response has been 100%
support.
Hear I would like to say a very big
THANKS JASPER, for making your
arduoustrekas public as you have.
Your doing so has paved the way
ahead and made It easier for myself
and the others that follow. Even
though, as I've said, I've had 100%
support there has been a tiny but of
negativity that's creptthrough. This
has been from a womyn with whom,
metamorphose
began 8-10
years ago, when
I first started to
"Now, here I
am, a new kid
in town"
on occasion,
I've had sex
with. I had, it
seems, been
take hormones her ideal
yet, didn't continue. Why? Why did
I stop? Why didn't I continue then?
Simply because the time wasn't
right. I didn't feel it from deep within,
like I do now. Also, there was the
matter of having a 6-8 year old
daughter.
The issue of having a daughter
though hasn't changed, only now
she's 16 years old. Unfortunately
forus, we live several hundred kms
apart and I've only been able lo tell
her over the phone. Soon we'll
have a chance to sit face to face
and talk about my decision to
change and to hopefully answer all
each others questions.
Maybe that could be another letter
for me to write? Right now, after
many years of self denial, my
image of what she referred to as a
"big butch dyke". Her absoluteturnon from a visual/mental
perspective. So guess who's
having a problem pinning this
womyn down privately and alone
for more than five minutes? Gest la
Vie. Because, I sure as hell ain't'
gonna let nobody else's ideals
stand in the way of mine.
Finally, all I can say now is that with
a blend of support from the lesbian
community, you guys out there
standing up and saying "I am here
and I'm happy/proud to be a man"
and from drawing on my own inner
resources, I GET STRONGER
EVERY DAY.
Happy living, yours in Brotherhood,
Max, SydnÂ£!'f
when you are in the wrong body. I have
no history of instability or attempted
suicide. I'm 31 years old and as such
like to think I have attained a degree of
maturity.Sowhythewait? ls it because
as genetic women we are dealing with
the medical profession which has
traditionally not always had our best
interest at heart, is this merely a
standard procedure that some of you
have also encountered, and am I just
over reacting because I am angry and
impatient? I'd welcome any feedback
from those of you who have had surgery
or are undergoing a similar process.
I'm aware of Dale having difficulties in
Victoria but would also like to hear from
others.
I've since decided to assert my right to
surgery how and when I choose it is
appropriate and have made an
appointment to see a female
psychiatrist highly recommended to
me. She may prove beneficial,
however, if all three psychiatrists agree
on the lengthy wait then I'll consider
that it is perhaps a necessity in my
particular case. Hopefully this doesn't
sound like sour grapes but a healthy
questioning of the transsexual
programme system. It is in no way an
indictment against the pyschiatrist
involved as this article reflects only my
personal evaluation of the process to
date.

MONTHLY NEWSLETTER #5 JULY 1992
Welcome lo the new look Boys Will
Be Boys newsletter. Yes, Jasper
has just acquired a new laser printer
with which to work with (thanks to
Wicked Women) and is terribly
excited. The new format is more
Â· cost effective, that is, it's actually
the same length as previous
newsletters but is obviously
condensed onto one double-sided
page which cuts my photocopying
cost by 60% (and looks pretty smart
loo). I've chosen a cowboy-style
type face for the newsletter which
is pretty corny but I thought we'd all
be macho enough to appreciate it!
Well, after my plea from the black
hole of publishing, I've had an influx
of contributions. Rrstly, Max has
written about himself and his
process. Again, it's fantastic that
you guys share with us all. Though
we may have many parallels, each
of our stories are different and
fascinating . Thanks Max and
welcome to the brotherhood.
Our feature article for this month
comes from the partner of Jamie
from Qld. Sheryl has kindly put into
words her perceptions of her
boyfriend and her relationship with
him. It's terrific that a partner of a
transsexual has shared her
thoughts. Quite often, we boys can
become quite self-obsessed with
our gender process and have a
tunnel-vision on that which is
happening around us. This, is a
natural reaction to what has got to
be one of the most fundamental (if
not the most fundamental) changes
INTRO
in life. Yet, as a result, we can be
quite oblivious to what our partners
and/or close friends and family are
going through. It is an equally
difficult challenge for those who
know us and love us to re-arrange
their perceptions of us on a gender
basis. Though the decision may
come as llttle surprise to them,
none-the-less, we are all
conditioned to behave toward and
think of both sexes in a differing
way. Thanks goes to Sheryl for
opening up and hopefully she may
inspire other partners and friends
of us men to write.

I've finally hopped on board the
merry-go-round of medical
psychiatrists in an attempt to get
approval forthe first of my surgeries.
I know that a few of you on this list
have already had some surgery, al
the very minimum, a double
mastectomy. I was referred by my
Endocrinologist to a psychiatrist
who regularly deals with
transsexual people. Anticipating a
series of appointments, I was quite
surprised when, after only my
second visit, he decided I would
not be eligible for any surgery for a
twelve month period. He has
referred me to another psychiatrist
for a second opinion. However, the
new doctor is also part of the
seemingly small circle of medical
professionals who deal with
transsexuals.
I was at first angered by the decision
but realise that a period of time is
necessary to convince the
authorities of our commitment.
However, after 18 months of
hormone treatment I figured I'd
almost paid my dues. I'd at least
expected a few more visits before
a decision was made of that nature.
I also felt a sense of powerlessness,
at a man, who doesn't know me,
making such a crucial decision on
my behalf. I got the impression,
from what my sister said of her
conversation with him (she was
asked in lo see the Dr as a family
perspective), that he has a rather
paternalistic view of women and
their bodies; a certain
preciousness. How could this
person or any other, understand
the trauma involved in seeing your
female body before you every time
you hop into the shower, the
discomfort of strapping down
especially through summer, the
inabilitytogoswimming, thefearof
being betrayed by your body
publicly, the reluctance to have sex
with anyone due to being
embarrassed by your own body?
Prior to the hormone treatment, I
was reasonably resigned to my
female body but basically indifferent
lo It. Now I find it intolerable. Once
you start, you are impatient to go
through the whole process. I feel in
between genders physically which
is distressing to say the least. I can
see no justifiable reason to wait a
further 12 months to have al least
my breasts removed. I am a
reasonably well-adjusted person,
as well-adjusted as you can be

NEWS
BEHIND THE
CAMERA
It seems as though another of our
members may be documented and
preserved forever on film! You may
remember last year Jasper was
featured in a 15min video called
F2M which has since been
screened in the U.S. Now Dale
from Melbourne, has been
approached by a film maker who
wishes to do something similar but
scripted with our infamous
Melbourne representative. Once
completed, the film will be screened
at local gay and lesbian film
festivals. Dale will keep us infonned
if and when the project goes ahead.
He first has to obviously way up the
pros and cons of public exposure
which is in itself a scary decision.
Good luck Dale.
GENDER IN
FORMATION
We received our first copy of Bet
and Lonnie's FTM newsletter titled
"Gender In Formation". The April
issue is a smart, four-paged
document on blue (of course!)
paper and professionally typed and
designed. It also features photo
reproductions which is great to see
(including a stunning photo of the
glamorous editors themselves).
This issue features reviews of a
Gender Bender Ball and a
transsexual lesbian performance
artist, Kate Bornstein, news and up
and coming events plus a historical
column called "Forefathers".
There's also a letter section and
the FTM group, which this
newsletter is a product of, is holding
regular meetings and events.
For a photocopy of this newsletter
send $1.30 which includes postage.
NEW BLOOD
Well, after a lull of about six months
or so, we've an influx of interest
and letters from new guys. Not only
were we made aware of a group of
five boys in Old, as mentioned in a
previous newsletter, but
the last two weeks has
brought to us three new
men; welcome Ross f~om
Bathurst, Christopherfrom
Sydney and Terry also
from Sydney. At times I
am not sure whether the
people who have written
to us are FTMs as it can be
confusing when a guy
signs his male name but
doesn't actually declare his
transsexuality. So quite
often I request a
confinnation of a person's
status before sending out
material.

Okay, seeing as none of you guys
have got the ball rolling on this one,
I've published a photograph of
myself (at a recent Wicked Women
event) so that our long-distance
relationship becomes a little more
intimate.I know many of you are
reluctant to send photos of
yourselves as you have not yet/
just begun your initial stages, but
hey, so what. Also, some of us
have changed dramatically and
look like men and may even have
had surgery so how about someone
volunteering for the next issue. It
all helps to create a sense of
community if when can put faces to
the names that appear in print.

#4 BWBB and was discussing it
with my lover, Jamie. He suggested
that maybe I should contribute
something to the newsletter and I

too certain (too cocksure) perhaps.
Whether these are specific
masculine quamies or not I don't
know but I do feel social
conditioning does have some part
to play here. But I'm sure that is
another discussion in itself.
Anyway, Jamie has acted very
masculine ever since I first met
him. Sometimes there was
confusion too, but maybe this was
because of the internal conflicts
accustomed to living as a male in
our house. Some of his friends
know and so there is some room to
act naturally with them . Other
people still see us as lesbian and
we let them see what they want. I
jump between him/her when I talk
about Jamie but I know how
masculine Jamie is when we make
love.

pre-surgery, pre-hormones). What
changes will occur only time will tell

me that he really felt like a man

female properties of his body.
