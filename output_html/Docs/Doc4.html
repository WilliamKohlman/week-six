Bl-MONTHLY NEWSLETTER #15OCT-NOV1993
FTM UPDATE
Yet another FTM
newsletter has arrived this
time featuring an
interesting and extensive
interview with writer
Maximillian Wolf, a review
of the Annual Convention
of the American
Psychiatric Association by
James Green , bits of
international news, lots of
letters and the
continuation of the
interview with Leslie
Feinberg titled "Gender
Outlaw". As usual, a very
good and informing read
with some great design
work now being done.
Subscribe to this I highly
recommend itl
BOYS OWN
Hot on the heels of FTM is
the latest "Boys Own"
newsletter which features
a large number of photos
(unfortunately badly
photocopied) of their
annual get together. The
guys look fantastic and
obviously had a wow of a
time. This issue centres
mainly upon phalloplasty.
Included is a sobering
article from a guy who has
suffered severe side
effects of the surgery
despite prior warning.
NEVv5
There is also a new section
called "Medical Tales" plus
media snippets and of course,
their extensive medical listings.
There's also a couple of tips on
chest binders. A great read and
well worth getting a hold of.
FTM RESOURCE
GUIDE
There is now 2 new FTM
Resource Guida available
compiled and published by the
FTM Network in America. The
FTM group has pooled its
resources and has published a
24p guide to Gender Self-Help
and Rap Groups, Gender
Information and Education
Groups, Gender Programs,
Medical Service Providers ,
Professional Societies, Public

prepaid. The Guide will be reissued each June.
TLC
The Transgender Liberation
Coalition recentl:1 held its
Annual General Meeting. No
details have been given to us
yet but we do know that Ben
has been appointed to the
new committee.
Congratulations Ben!
EXPERIMENTATION
Max and Jasper are currently
experimenting with a litre of
liquid latex and God knows
what else in order to home
grow a prosthetic. Any
suggested designs would be
welcome. Hopefully we can
prototype something
affordable and local for all
boys interested. Wish us luck!
SACHA TO HIT
U.K.
Next year, Sacha (Old) will
be taking flight to England for
2 weeks and has offered to
be a BWBB representative,
sharing information and talks.
This is terrific and we wish
Sacha well.

REVIEW: POLARE
The first Polare magazine has
been published by Sydney's
Gender Centre and is defined
as a "journal on gender issues".
Pol are is a quarterly publication
and is funded by the Centre
who in turn is funded by the
Department of Community
Services under the SAAP
Program and also by the NSW
Health Department under the
AIDS Program.
The theme of the first edition is
historical with a number of
articles which turn an eye to the
past, such as "The Scene was
Mean": a brief history of drag in
Sydney in the '80s, "The History
of Seahorse" and "Great
Outings of History".
The magazine is designed to
"report on cultural and social
change in the '90s and aims to
raise awareness about gender
issues and the needs of the
people with gender issues, their
partners, families and friends."
in plus the Presidential report.
There's a letters page and a
news section plus an important
Directory assistance.
And of course, we men are
represented thanks to Max, and
his daughter, for the ir
perspective under the column
banner of "A Male Point of
View".
Polare is a worthwh ile and
interesting publication and
deserves wide support. A
publication can only continue
to expand and excite if it is fed
by many contributions. Please
consider sending your
viewpoints to Polare for
publication or just write them a
letter of thanks and support.
It's currently a free mag so be
quick to write away for your
copy before financial restriction
sees the introduction of a
subscription ree.
