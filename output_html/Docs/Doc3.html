Dear Jasper,
The contact and the newsletters
have given me the hope to keep
going after hitting another very low
spot after being told that I would
not be supported in my belief that
I am a Transsexual after 2 years in
therapy struggling with depression
trying to stay sane and looking
desperately for a million "other"
reasons why I feel the way I am; a
male in a female body which came
to light in previous few years of
therapy by feeling safe and allowing
myself to 'foel", stop denying and
to think about "me" for the firsttime
in my life.
That first therapy started out initially
for problems within my still longstanding marriage. I also have
teenage children and am not "out"
to anyone except finally to myself.
I am now just trying to deal with
many things, including guilt. self
esteem and getting some everyday
life skills like being with people,
learning how to drive and deciding
what course I will take to finding
some employment and trying to
find the courage I know I need to
stop hiding so I can one day live
the life I want to live not just the
way others have always expected
or told me to.
Regards,
William, NSW
Ed: Thanks to William for sharing
honestly about himself. We have
all been in a similar position of
psychological distress at one time
or another and I wish him well in
his endevourto become functional
and healthy. Thanks to William for
also donating $20 to BWBBs -
much appreciated!
Dear Jasper,
I have noticed a bit of media
attention fom;sed on FTMs, on
such programs as "The Opposite
Sex" on the ABC, where a 40 year
old FTM named Peter was talking,
quite comfortably, about himself.
To see a man. living as a man, for
25 years was inspiring for me. I
can count almost 2 years in my
experience & I sincerely
believe, had I not done this, I
would be alive otherwise.
Then, a mainstream
magazine, Cleo, features an
FTM story. I find it all so
productive to see us
recognised & having our
"condition" addressed & so
accessible. Six years ago,
when I was frantically
scouring for information - to
work out just what the hell I
was - there was nothing,
except medical books. So, I
feel like something is finally
being achieved. Of course,
the day when we can live in
society without being
concerned about being
"found out" is yet to come.
Still, I keep positive & wish
you the best.
Keep up the good work,
Julian, NSW
ED: It's great to have Julians
opinions and thanks to him
for donating $20 to our
ongoing mailing costs.

with the harness to get
everything sitting right and
comfortable for you . The
harness is made from flesh
coloured elastic and is quite
comfortable to wear.
Rhonnie's magic pwder is
nothing more than Shower

available on any supermarket

feel good and stops any
problems with chafing."

~"_(crn_r v_1sn~I ~I _nc_~ro_~n_____. Recently, Max and Jasper met
with Sascha on his visit to
Sydney. Sascha resides in
Brisbane and is part of our
BWBB network. It was great to
meet with yet another boy and
to listen to his process to date.
At21, Sascha gave old farts like
Max and Jasper a fresh
perspective on how we attempt
to view the world as men.

keep in touch.

A tip from the Melbourne network
is in response to a recently
published FTM article in the
Australian Transsexual Support
Association newsletter by Jamie.
In his column Jamie urged new
boys to work out at the gym in
preparation for eventual breast
surgery. The Melbourne boys
take the opposite view, stating
that their surgeons have
recommended that no pee buildup be attempted until after
surgery. The reason being that
it makes it more difficult to locate
the tissue to be removed and
creates extra scarring having to
go under muscle to remove
tissue as well as causing
problems for nipple re-location.
Perhaps it is best to consult your
own surgeon as to the correct
action to take. Thanks guys.
The Transgender Liberation
Coalition has been busy in Sydney
of late having launched the Stop
The Violence t gainst Trannies
campaign . As part of this
campaign, they are undertaking a
confidential survey of violence and
harrassment as experienced by
we trannies. A fundraiser for the
campaign was held with the recent
special screen;ng of the genderblurred film "Orlando" plus a
cabaret night at the infamous
Bottoms Up bar in Kings Cross.
The TLC is also having regular
meetings with key politicians in
order to secure changes to the
Anti-Discrimination Act of NSW.
This is a group well worth
supporting.
Grnorn crnru llNK
Jasper, on invitation, recently gave
a discussion at the newly formed
Gender Centre, formally known as
Tiresia's House. Although the
Gender Centre still operates two
relief accomodation houses, the
Petersham location is now purely
office space and houses a number
of workers including
developmental and outreach
workers. The Centre employs both
trannies and many non-trannies of
both sexes (no FTMs as yet) and
were keen to gain a perspective on
FTM issues, hence Jaspers visit. It
is hoped that BWBB and the Centre
will maintain a regular link and that
the Centre will help with our
newsletter's on going costs.
We are also negotiating to
have our conference at their
office with refreshments and
resources provided by the
Centre.

Early last year, there was a
whisper amongst the TS men
of a new device from the
States. The word was that a
TS brother had designed a
strap-on penis one could
urinate with as well as have
sex. For some of us, it caused
no small amount of
excitement. No more would
we have to shove socks down
our jocks, no more with the gel in
a condom, no more keeping our
erections (usually a dildoe of
some description) in the bedside
drawer. At last we could feel like
real men! A couple of us quickly
wrote away to the USA for the
information packs. The first info
packs were little more than
American hard-sell. We were
told of the wonders this new
device would perform in our lives
but nothing about HOW it
actually worked . More
information was written away
for. The second info packs told
us a little more of how things
were supposed to work but
lacked in any photos of ihe
various bits and pieces.
As I was in the best financial
position, I sent away for one of
Rhonnie Reeds devices, then
known as 'HERB" ( Helping
Every Reborn Brother). Overthe
next couple of months, my phone
bill rose to dizzying heights and
my typewriterwas smoking from
the number of letters I sent to
Rhonnie. Some of the delay
re ~tu re
the arrival of my own HERB, I have
been unable to contact Rhonnie in
any way. I have written a couple of
letters and spent a kings ransom in
phone calls. My letters, to date,
remain unanswered and I have
only been able to get his answering
machine when I call. The message
on his machine stated he was in
hospital until the 21st of July but
calls made after that date have
gotten the same message as
before. I started to feel like I'd been
ripped off.
A couple of weeks ago I spoke to a
friend in the States and was filled
in on what Rhonnie and his devices
are really about. It appears I am
not the only one who has this
problem of non-contact. My friend
also owns a HERB and had similar
problems with it as I did. He only
lives a couple of hundred miles
from Rhonnie and gues what...he
can't get hold of hime either. This
tells one a great deal about
Rhonnie.
Another bit of Truth my friend told
me was that the HERB only comes
in one size! Even though on the
order form there is three. Speaking
from direct experience, that one
size is far too big for practical
purposes (like standing, walking
and sitting). From what I was told,
Rhonnie seems to surface now
and then, flash around whatever
devices he is touting at the time
and then sinks away with the sunset
once he has gotten our money.
This is not what I would call very
brotherly behaviour. I would advise
at this point, that the rest of my
brothers have nothing to do with
Rhonnie and his devices. Some of
us just can't afford to lose $A750
his HERB costs us. I am quite
prepared to be corrected on this
issue but as things stand at present,
Rhonnie Reed is too high a risk.
Jamie B. QLD
Ed: Jamie has since heard from
Rhonnie but his opinions have not
greatly altered. Rhonnie has
offered to exchange Jamie's HERB
for a smaller, more practical, one
at a further cost of US$100.
Below: the U.D silicone device
was due to health problems ------------------------~
and were therefore
forgivable. However some
of the delay could not be
excused or forgiven .
Eventually though, it did
arrive.
After carefully reading all the
directions and following
them to the letter, there were
still problems. Before my
HERB arrived, Rhonnie had
asssured me (many times)
he was standing behind his
product and would help with
any problems if they came
up. Now forthe reality. Since
